            " LONDON, England (Reuters) -- Harry Potter star Daniel Radcliffe gains access to a reported £20 million ($41.1 million) fortune as he turns 18 on Monday, but he insists the money won't cast a spell on him. Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter in \"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\" To the disappointment of gossip columnists around the world, the young actor says he has no plans to fritter his cash away on fast cars, drink and celebrity parties. \"I don't plan to be one of those people who, as soon as they turn 18, suddenly buy themselves a massive sports car collection or something similar,\" he told an Australian interviewer earlier this month. \"I don't think I'll be particularly extravagant. \"The things I like buying are things that cost about 10 pounds -- books and CDs and DVDs.\" At 18, Radcliffe will be able to gamble in a casino, buy a drink in a pub or see the horror film \"Hostel: Part II,\" currently six places below his number one movie on the UK box office chart. Details of how he'll mark his landmark birthday are under wraps. His agent and publicist had no comment on his plans. \"I'll definitely have some sort of party,\" he said in an interview. \"Hopefully none of you will be reading about it.\" Radcliffe's earnings from the first five Potter films have been held in a trust fund which he has not been able to touch. Despite his growing fame and riches, the actor says he is keeping his feet firmly on the ground. \"People are always looking to say 'kid star goes off the rails,'\" he told reporters last month. \"But I try very hard not to go that way because it would be too easy for them.\" His latest outing as the boy wizard in \"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\" is breaking records on both sides of the Atlantic and he will reprise the role in the last two films.  Watch I-Reporter give her review of Potter's latest » . There is life beyond Potter, however. The Londoner has filmed a TV movie called \"My Boy Jack,\" about author Rudyard Kipling and his son, due for release later this year. He will also appear in \"December Boys,\" an Australian film about four boys who escape an orphanage. Earlier this year, he made his stage debut playing a tortured teenager in Peter Shaffer's \"Equus.\" Meanwhile, he is braced for even closer media scrutiny now that he's legally an adult: \"I just think I'm going to be more sort of fair game,\" he told Reuters.

            " Presenter: Good afternoon, everyone. Today we're going to talk about the basics of machine learning. Machine learning is a method of teaching computers to learn from data, without being explicitly programmed. There are three types of machine learning: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.Slide 1: Types of Machine LearningSupervised Learning: learning from labeled dataUnsupervised Learning: learning from unlabeled dataReinforcement Learning: learning from reward or punishmentPresenter: In supervised learning, the computer is trained on labeled data, which means the input data is labeled with the correct output. The computer then uses this training data to make predictions on new, unseen data.Slide 2: Supervised LearningLabeled data: input data labeled with correct outputComputer uses labeled data to make predictions on unseen dataPresenter: In unsupervised learning, the computer is trained on unlabeled data, which means the input data is not labeled with the correct output. The computer then uses this training data to find patterns or structures in the data.Slide 3: Unsupervised LearningUnlabeled data: input data not labeled with correct outputComputer uses unlabeled data to find patterns or structures in the dataPresenter: In reinforcement learning, the computer learns from reward or punishment. The computer is given a task and then receives feedback on its performance. Based on this feedback, the computer adjusts its behavior to maximize its reward.Slide 4: Reinforcement LearningComputer learns from reward or punishmentGiven a task and receives feedback on performanceAdjusts behavior to maximize rewardPresenter: That's a brief overview of the basics of machine learning. I hope you found it helpful.\n"
