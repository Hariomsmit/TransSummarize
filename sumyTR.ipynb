            "At 18, Radcliffe will be able to gamble in a casino, buy a drink in a pub or see the horror film \"Hostel: Part II,\" currently six places below his number one movie on the UK box office chart.\n",
            "Radcliffe's earnings from the first five Potter films have been held in a trust fund which he has not been able to touch.\n",
            "Despite his growing fame and riches, the actor says he is keeping his feet firmly on the ground.\n",
            "His latest outing as the boy wizard in \"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\" is breaking records on both sides of the Atlantic and he will reprise the role in the last two films.\n",
            "Meanwhile, he is braced for even closer media scrutiny now that he's legally an adult: \"I just think I'm going to be more sort of fair game,\" he told Reuters.\n"
