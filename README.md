# TransSummarize
Aim of the Project: 
The project for TransSummarize aims to help in taking information from a conversation or an original audio data. It will reduce the time and effort of manual documentation. Sometimes, the main points from a communication in the same language tends to be missed due to accent according to the person.
This project will combine speech recognition and text summarization features. In small scenarios like class, this feature will be helpful as it can provide
summarizing lectures into a document without losing vital information.

Problem Definition:
From any conversation, when there is an event that we want to extract information out of, we have to manually do it by ourselves. For this, there are separate applications for speech recognition as well as text summarization. But for convenience, why not an application which does both? At the comfort of our fingertips, we should be able to get important written information from a conversation.
